# LocalMultiplayerVRTemplate (StolenNotOurWork)
# Credits for Template to Maximilian Flack

This template was created for our research project in the Master's programme in Media Informatics at the HFU. It is designed to help people easily develop their own colocated multiplayer VR applications.

(The template is based on the [Multiplayer VR Template by Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.template.vr-multiplayer@2.0/manual/index.html) and has been modified for use on a local network)

Developed by Maximilian Flack and Noam Hartmann and supervised by Prof. Nikolaus Hottong.
